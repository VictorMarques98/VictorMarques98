      Welcome to my profile, I'm currently a Front-End developer and I aim to be one of the best React   developers in the world. I've worked with many kinds of projects, from simple landing page projects to complex applications like a crypto trading platform and a entire desing system library. Currently my focus is being an expert in React, Nextjs and Typescript but I have knowledge in React Native too. You can see all my projects in my "portfolio" or see below a summary of each one. Oh, I have great conversational English!
